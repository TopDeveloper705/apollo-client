Fetching data in a simple, predictable way is one of the core features of Apollo Client. This article shows how to fetch GraphQL data in React with the `useQuery` hook and attach the result to your UI. You'll also learn how Apollo Client simplifies data management code by tracking error and loading states for you.

## Prerequisites

This article assumes you're familiar with building basic GraphQL queries. If you need a refresher, we recommend that you [read this guide](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/) and [practice running queries in GraphiQL](/features/developer-tooling/#features). Apollo Client queries are just standard GraphQL, so any query that runs in GraphiQL will also run when provided to `useQuery`.

This article also assumes that you've already set up Apollo Client and have wrapped your React app in an `ApolloProvider` component. Read our [getting started guide](/essentials/get-started/) if you need help with either of those steps.

> To follow along with the examples below, open up our [starter project](https://codesandbox.io/s/j2ly83749w) and [sample GraphQL server](https://codesandbox.io/s/32ypr38l61) on CodeSandbox. You can view the completed version of the app [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/n3jykqpxwm).

## The `useQuery` hook

The `useQuery` hook, which is based on the React [Hooks API](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), is one of the most important building blocks of your Apollo application. To run a query within a React component, you simply pass `useQuery` a GraphQL query string. When your component renders, `useQuery` returns an object from Apollo Client that contains `loading`, `error`, and `data` properties you can use to render your UI.

Let's look at an example. First, we'll create a GraphQL query named `GET_DOGS`. Remember to wrap query strings in the `gql` function to parse them into query documents:

<MultiCodeBlock>
<div data-language="Hooks (JavaScript)">

```tsx:title=index.js
import gql from 'graphql-tag';
import { useQuery } from '@apollo/react-hooks';

const GET_DOGS = gql`
  {
    dogs {
      id
      breed
    }
  }
`;
```

</div>
<div data-language="Render Props (JavaScript)">

```tsx:title=index.js
import gql from 'graphql-tag';
import { Query } from 'react-apollo';

const GET_DOGS = gql`
  {
    dogs {
      id
      breed
    }
  }
`;
```

</div>
</MultiCodeBlock>

Next, from within a component named `Dogs`, we'll pass our `GET_DOGS` query to the `useQuery` hook:

<MultiCodeBlock>
<div data-language="Hooks (JavaScript)">

```tsx:title=index.js
function Dogs({ onDogSelected }) {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_DOGS);

  if (loading) return 'Loading...';
  if (error) return `Error! ${error.message}`;

  return (
    <select name="dog" onChange={onDogSelected}>
      {data.dogs.map(dog => (
        <option key={dog.id} value={dog.breed}>
          {dog.breed}
        </option>
      ))}
    </select>
  );
}
```

</div>
<div data-language="Render Props (JavaScript)">

```tsx:title=index.js
const Dogs = ({ onDogSelected }) => (
  <Query query={GET_DOGS}>
    {({ loading, error, data }) => {
      if (loading) return 'Loading...';
      if (error) return `Error! ${error.message}`;

      return (
        <select name="dog" onChange={onDogSelected}>
          {data.dogs.map(dog => (
            <option key={dog.id} value={dog.breed}>
              {dog.breed}
            </option>
          ))}
        </select>
      );
    }}
  </Query>
);
```

</div>
</MultiCodeBlock>

As this snippet shows, when the `loading`, `error`, and `data` properties are populated by the `useQuery` hook, we can intelligently render different UI elements depending on the state of the query.

In this case, the `Dogs` component presents a `Loading...` message until Apollo Client receives data from the server. When the data is received, the component renders a dropdown menu that's populated with the received list of dog breeds.

When the user selects a dog breed from the dropdown menu, the selection is sent to the parent component via the provided `onDogSelected` function.

In the next step, we'll hook the dropdown menu up to a more complex query that uses variables.

## Receiving data

You've already seen a preview of how to work with the result of your query returned by the `useQuery` hook. Let's dive deeper into what's happening behind the scenes with Apollo Client when we fetch data with `useQuery`.

1. When `useQuery` is called the first time, Apollo Client creates an observable for our query. Our component subscribes to the result of the query via the Apollo Client cache.
2. Initially, we try to load the query result from the Apollo cache. If it's not in there, we send the request to the server.
3. Once the data comes back, we normalize it and store it in the Apollo cache. Since the `useQuery` hook subscribes to the result internally, it updates with the data reactively.

To see Apollo Client's caching in action, let's build our `DogPhoto` component. `DogPhoto` accepts a prop called `breed` that reflects the current value of our form from the `Dogs` component above.

<MultiCodeBlock>
<div data-language="Hooks (JavaScript)">

```jsx
const GET_DOG_PHOTO = gql`
  query Dog($breed: String!) {
    dog(breed: $breed) {
      id
      displayImage
    }
  }
`;

function DogPhoto({ breed }) {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_DOG_PHOTO, {
    variables: { breed },
  });

  if (loading) return null;
  if (error) return `Error! ${error}`;

  return (
    <img src={data.dog.displayImage} style={{ height: 100, width: 100 }} />
  );
}
```

</div>
<div data-language="Render Props (JavaScript)">

```jsx
const GET_DOG_PHOTO = gql`
  query Dog($breed: String!) {
    dog(breed: $breed) {
      id
      displayImage
    }
  }
`;

const DogPhoto = ({ breed }) => (
  <Query query={GET_DOG_PHOTO} variables={{ breed }}>
    {({ loading, error, data }) => {
      if (loading) return null;
      if (error) return `Error! ${error}`;

      return (
        <img src={data.dog.displayImage} style={{ height: 100, width: 100 }} />
      );
    }}
  </Query>
);
```

</div>
</MultiCodeBlock>

You'll notice that we're using a new configuration option with our `useQuery` hook. The `variables` option is an object containing the variables we want to pass to our GraphQL query. In this case, we want to pass the breed from the form into our query.

Try selecting "bulldog" from the list to see its photo show up. Then, switch to another breed and switch back to "bulldog". You'll notice that the bulldog photo loads instantaneously the second time around. This is the Apollo cache at work!

Next, let's learn some techniques for ensuring our data is fresh, such as polling and refetching.

## Polling and refetching

It's awesome that Apollo Client caches your data for you, but what should we do when we want fresh data? Two solutions are polling and refetching.

Polling can help us achieve near real-time data by causing the query to refetch on a specified interval. To implement polling, simply pass a `pollInterval` option into the `useQuery` hook with the interval in ms. If you pass in 0, the query will not poll. You can also implement dynamic polling by using the `startPolling` and `stopPolling` functions that are returned by the `useQuery` hook.

<MultiCodeBlock>
<div data-language="Hooks (JavaScript)">

```jsx
function DogPhoto({ breed }) {
  const { loading, error, data, startPolling, stopPolling } = useQuery(
    GET_DOG_PHOTO,
    {
      variables: { breed },
      skip: !breed,
      pollInterval: 500,
    },
  );

  if (loading) return null;
  if (error) return `Error! ${error}`;

  return (
    <img src={data.dog.displayImage} style={{ height: 100, width: 100 }} />
  );
}
```

</div>
<div data-language="Render Props (JavaScript)">

```jsx
const DogPhoto = ({ breed }) => (
  <Query
    query={GET_DOG_PHOTO}
    variables={{ breed }}
    skip={!breed}
    pollInterval={500}
  >
    {({ loading, error, data, startPolling, stopPolling }) => {
      if (loading) return null;
      if (error) return `Error! ${error}`;

      return (
        <img src={data.dog.displayImage} style={{ height: 100, width: 100 }} />
      );
    }}
  </Query>
);
```

</div>
</MultiCodeBlock>

By setting the `pollInterval` to 500, you should see a new dog image every .5 seconds. Polling is an excellent way to achieve near-realtime data without the complexity of setting up GraphQL subscriptions.

What if you want to reload the query in response to a user action instead of an interval? That's where the `refetch` function comes in! Here, we're adding a button to our `DogPhoto` component that will trigger a refetch when clicked. `refetch` takes variables, but if we don't pass in new variables, it will use the same ones from our previous query.

<MultiCodeBlock>
<div data-language="Hooks (JavaScript)">

```jsx
function DogPhoto({ breed }) {
  const { loading, error, data, refetch } = useQuery(GET_DOG_PHOTO, {
    variables: { breed },
    skip: !breed,
  });

  if (loading) return null;
  if (error) return `Error! ${error}`;

  return (
    <div>
      <img src={data.dog.displayImage} style={{ height: 100, width: 100 }} />
      <button onClick={() => refetch()}>Refetch!</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

</div>
<div data-language="Render Props (JavaScript)">

```jsx
const DogPhoto = ({ breed }) => (
  <Query query={GET_DOG_PHOTO} variables={{ breed }} skip={!breed}>
    {({ loading, error, data, refetch }) => {
      if (loading) return null;
      if (error) return `Error! ${error}`;

      return (
        <div>
          <img
            src={data.dog.displayImage}
            style={{ height: 100, width: 100 }}
          />
          <button onClick={() => refetch()}>Refetch!</button>
        </div>
      );
    }}
  </Query>
);
```

</div>
</MultiCodeBlock>

If you click the button, you'll notice that our UI updates with a new dog photo. Refetching is an excellent way to guarantee fresh data, but it introduces some added complexity with loading state. In the next section, you'll learn strategies to handle complex loading and error state.

## Loading and error state

We've already seen how Apollo Client exposes our query's loading and error state in the result object returned by `useQuery`. These properties are helpful when the query initially loads, but what happens to our loading state when we're refetching or polling?

Let's go back to our refetching example from the previous section. If you click on the refetch button, you'll see that the component doesn't re-render until the new data arrives. What if we want to indicate to the user that we're refetching the photo?

Luckily, Apollo Client provides fine-grained information about the status of our query via the `networkStatus` property in the `useQuery` result object. We also need to set the option `notifyOnNetworkStatusChange` to true so our query component re-renders while a refetch is in flight.

<MultiCodeBlock>
<div data-language="Hooks (JavaScript)">

```jsx
function DogPhoto({ breed }) {
  const { loading, error, data, refetch, networkStatus } = useQuery(
    GET_DOG_PHOTO,
    {
      variables: { breed },
      skip: !breed,
      notifyOnNetworkStatusChange: true,
    },
  );

  if (networkStatus === 4) return 'Refetching!';
  if (loading) return null;
  if (error) return `Error! ${error}`;

  return (
    <div>
      <img src={data.dog.displayImage} style={{ height: 100, width: 100 }} />
      <button onClick={() => refetch()}>Refetch!</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

</div>
<div data-language="Render Props (JavaScript)">

```jsx
const DogPhoto = ({ breed }) => (
  <Query
    query={GET_DOG_PHOTO}
    variables={{ breed }}
    skip={!breed}
    notifyOnNetworkStatusChange
  >
    {({ loading, error, data, refetch, networkStatus }) => {
      if (networkStatus === 4) return 'Refetching!';
      if (loading) return null;
      if (error) return `Error! ${error}`;

      return (
        <div>
          <img
            src={data.dog.displayImage}
            style={{ height: 100, width: 100 }}
          />
          <button onClick={() => refetch()}>Refetch!</button>
        </div>
      );
    }}
  </Query>
);
```

</div>
</MultiCodeBlock>

The `networkStatus` property is an enum with number values from 1-8 representing a different loading state. 4 corresponds to a refetch, but there are also numbers for polling and pagination. For a full list of all the possible loading states, check out the [reference guide](/api/react-hooks/).

While not as complex as loading state, responding to errors in your component is also customizable via the `useQuery` `errorPolicy` option. The default value for `errorPolicy` is "none" in which we treat all GraphQL errors as runtime errors. In the event of an error, Apollo Client will discard any data that came back with the request and set the `error` property in the `useQuery` result object to true. If you'd like to show any partial data along with any error information, set the `errorPolicy` to "all".

## Manually firing a query

When React mounts and renders a component that calls the `useQuery` hook, Apollo Client automatically fires off your query. What if you wanted to delay firing your query until the user performs an action, such as clicking on a button?

One option is to leverage the `useApolloClient` hook and directly call `client.query()` instead.

<MultiCodeBlock>
<div data-language="Hooks (JavaScript)">

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useApolloClient } from '@apollo/react-hooks';

function DelayedQuery() {
  const [dog, setDog] = useState(null);
  const client = useApolloClient();

  return (
    <div>
      {dog && <img src={dog.displayImage} />}
      <button
        onClick={async () => {
          const { data } = await client.query({
            query: GET_DOG_PHOTO,
            variables: { breed: 'bulldog' },
          });
          setDog(data.dog);
        }}
      >
        Click me!
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

</div>
<div data-language="Render Props (JavaScript)">

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { ApolloConsumer } from 'react-apollo';

class DelayedQuery extends Component {
  state = { dog: null };

  onDogFetched = dog => this.setState(() => ({ dog }));

  render() {
    return (
      <ApolloConsumer>
        {client => (
          <div>
            {this.state.dog && <img src={this.state.dog.displayImage} />}
            <button
              onClick={async () => {
                const { data } = await client.query({
                  query: GET_DOG_PHOTO,
                  variables: { breed: 'bulldog' },
                });
                this.onDogFetched(data.dog);
              }}
            >
              Click me!
            </button>
          </div>
        )}
      </ApolloConsumer>
    );
  }
}
```

</div>
</MultiCodeBlock>

While fetching this way gives you fine-grained control over how the query is called, it is more verbose. As an alternative, we recommend using the `useLazyQuery` hook.

The `useLazyQuery` hook acts just like the `useQuery` hook, with one main exception. When `useLazyQuery` is called, it does not immediately execute the defined query. Instead, it returns an execution function in its result tuple, that can then be triggered whenever you're ready to call the query.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useLazyQuery } from '@apollo/react-hooks';

function DelayedQuery() {
  const [dog, setDog] = useState(null);
  const [getDog, { loading, data }] = useLazyQuery(GET_DOG_PHOTO);

  if (loading) return <p>Loading ...</p>;

  if (data && data.dog) {
    setDog(data.dog);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {dog && <img src={dog.displayImage} />}
      <button onClick={() => getDog({ variables: { breed: 'bulldog' } })}>
        Click me!
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## useQuery API overview

If you're looking for an overview of all the options `useQuery` accepts, and its result properties, look no further! Most `useQuery` calls will not need all of these configuration options, but it's useful to know that they exist. If you'd like to learn about the `useQuery` hook API in more detail with usage examples, visit our [reference guide](/api/react-hooks/).

> **Note:** If you're using React Apollo's `Query` render prop component, the option/result details listed below are still valid (options are component props and results are passed into the render prop function). The only difference is that a `query` prop (which holds a GraphQL query document parsed into an AST by `graphql-tag`) is also required.

<h3>Options</h3>

The `useQuery` hook accepts the following options.

<QueryOptions />

<h3>Result</h3>

After being called the `useQuery` hook will return a result object with the following properties. This object contains your query result, plus some helpful functions for refetching, dynamic polling, and pagination.

<QueryResult />

## Next steps

Learning how to leverage the `useQuery` hook to fetch data is one of the most important skills to mastering development with Apollo Client. Now that you're a pro at fetching data, why not try using the `useMutation` hook to update your data? Here are some resources we think will help you level up your skills:

- [Mutations](/essentials/mutations/): Learn how to update data with mutations and when you'll need to update the Apollo cache. For a full list of options, check out the API reference for the `useMutation` hook.
- [Local state management](/essentials/local-state/): Learn how to query local data.
- [Pagination](/features/pagination/): Building lists has never been easier thanks to Apollo Client's `fetchMore` function. Learn more in our pagination tutorial.
