import MutationOptions from '../../shared/mutation-options.mdx';
import MutationResult from '../../shared/mutation-result.mdx';

Now that we've [learned how to query data](queries/) from our backend with Apollo Client, the natural next step is to learn how to _modify_ back-end data with **mutations**.

This article demonstrates how to send updates to your GraphQL server with the `useMutation` hook. You'll also learn how to update the Apollo Client cache after executing a mutation, and how to track loading and error states.

> To follow along with the examples below, open up our [starter project](https://codesandbox.io/s/mutations-example-app-start-gm7i5) and [sample GraphQL server](https://codesandbox.io/s/mutations-example-app-server-sxewr) on CodeSandbox. You can view the completed version of the app [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/mutations-example-app-final-tjoje).

## Prerequisites

This article assumes you're familiar with building basic GraphQL mutations. If you need a refresher, we recommend that you
[read this guide](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations).

This article also assumes that you've already set up Apollo Client and have wrapped your React app in an `ApolloProvider` component. For help with those steps, [get started](../get-started/).

## Executing a mutation

The `useMutation` [React hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) is the primary API for executing mutations in an Apollo application.

To execute a mutation, you first call `useMutation` within a React component and pass it the mutation you want to execute, like so:

```jsx{13}:title=my-component.jsx
import { gql, useMutation } from '@apollo/client';

// Define mutation
const INCREMENT_COUNTER = gql`
  # Increments a back-end counter and gets its resulting value
  mutation IncrementCounter {
    currentValue
  }
`;

function MyComponent() {
  // Pass mutation to useMutation
  const [mutateFunction, { data, loading, error }] = useMutation(INCREMENT_COUNTER);
}
```

As shown above, you use the `gql` function to parse the mutation string into a GraphQL document that you then pass to `useMutation`.

When your component renders, `useMutation` returns a tuple that includes:

* A **mutate function** that you can call at any time to execute the mutation
    * Unlike `useQuery`, `useMutation` _doesn't_ execute its operation automatically on render. Instead, you call the mutate function.
* An object with fields that represent the current status of the mutation's execution (`data`, `loading`, etc.)
    * This object is similar to the object returned by the `useQuery` hook. For details, see [Result](#result).

### Example

Let's say we're creating a to-do list application and we want the user to be able to add items to their list. First, we'll create a corresponding GraphQL mutation named `ADD_TODO`. Remember to wrap GraphQL strings in the `gql` function to parse them into query documents:

```jsx:title=add-todo.jsx
import { gql, useMutation } from '@apollo/client';

const ADD_TODO = gql`
  mutation AddTodo($text: String!) {
    addTodo(text: $text) {
      id
      text
    }
  }
`;
```

Next, we'll create a component named `AddTodo` that represents the submission form for the to-do list. Inside it, we'll pass our
`ADD_TODO` mutation to the `useMutation` hook:

```jsx{3,13}:title=add-todo.jsx
function AddTodo() {
  let input;
  const [addTodo, { data, loading, error }] = useMutation(ADD_TODO);

  if (loading) return 'Submitting...';
  if (error) return `Submission error! ${error.message}`;

  return (
    <div>
      <form
        onSubmit={e => {
          e.preventDefault();
          addTodo({ variables: { text: input.value } });
          input.value = '';
        }}
      >
        <input
          ref={node => {
            input = node;
          }}
        />
        <button type="submit">Add Todo</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, our `form`'s `onSubmit` handler calls the **mutate function** (named `addTodo`) that's returned by the `useMutation` hook. This tells Apollo Client to execute the mutation by sending it to our GraphQL server.

> Note that this behavior differs from [`useQuery`](./queries/), which executes its operation as soon as its component renders. This is because mutations are more commonly executed in response to a user action (such as submitting a form in this case).

### Providing options

The `useMutation` hook accepts an `options` object as its second parameter. Here's an example that provides some default `variables`:

```js
const [addTodo, { data, loading, error }] = useMutation(ADD_TODO, {
  variables: {
    text: "placeholder",
    someOtherVariable: 1234,
  },
});
```

> All supported options are listed in [Options](#options).

You can _also_ provide these options to your mutate function, as demonstrated in [the example above](#example):

```js
addTodo({
  variables: {
    text: input.value,
  },
});
```

Here, we're using the `variables` option to provide the values of any GraphQL variables that our mutation requires (specifically, the `text` of the created to-do item).

If you provide the same option to both `useMutation` _and_ your mutate function, the value you provide your mutate function takes precedence. In this case, `variables.text` will end up equal to `input.value`, overriding the `"placeholder"` text. The two `variables` objects are merged shallowly, so `variables.someOtherVariable` is preserved. This preservation is convenient, since it means passing `variables` to the mutate function won't discard other `variables` you passed to the `useMutation` function.

### Tracking mutation status

In addition to a mutate function, the `useMutation` hook returns an object that represents the current state of the mutation's execution. The fields of this object (listed in [Result](#result)) include booleans that indicate whether the mutate function has been `called` yet, and whether the mutation's result is currently `loading`.

[The example above](#example) destructures the `loading` and `error` fields from this object to render the `AddTodo` component differently depending on the mutation's current status:

```jsx
if (loading) return 'Submitting...';
if (error) return `Submission error! ${error.message}`;
```

> The `useMutation` hook also supports `onCompleted` and `onError` options if you prefer to use callbacks. [See the API reference.](../api/react/hooks/#options-2)

## Updating the cache after a mutation

When you execute a mutation, you modify back-end data. You often then want to update your _locally cached_ data to reflect that back-end modification. For example, if you execute a mutation to add an item to your to-do list, you also want that item to appear in your local copy of the list.

### Available methods

The most straightforward way to update your local data is to **refetch any queries** that might be affected by the mutation. However, this method requires additional network requests.

If your mutation returns all of the objects and fields that it modified, you can **update the cache directly** _without_ making any network requests. However, this method increases in complexity as your mutations become more complex.

If you're just getting started with Apollo Client, we recommend refetching queries to update your cached data. After you get that working, you can improve your app's performance by updating the cache directly instead.

### Refetching queries

If you happen to know that certain queries always (or usually) need to be refetched from the network after a particular kind of mutation, you can identify them by passing a `refetchQueries: [...]` array in the mutation options.

Typically, the elements of the `refetchQueries` array will be the string names of queries you want to refetch. Remember to give your queries unique names if you want to refer to them this way:

```js
const [addTodo, { data, loading, error }] = useMutation(ADD_TODO, {
  refetchQueries: ["GetTodos"],
});
```

You can also specify queries using a `DocumentNode` object, or pass `refetchQueries` to the `addTodo` mutate function, instead of passing it to `useMutation`:

```js
addTodo({
  variables: {
    text: input.value,
  },
  refetchQueries: [GET_TODOS],
})
```

With only one query to refetch, this manual specification of `refetchQueries` may not seem very difficult. However, in larger applications, it can become tricky to guess which queries should be updated after an arbitrary mutation.

### Updating the cache directly

TODO

#### Include modified objects in mutation responses

In most cases, a mutation response should include any object(s) the mutation modified. This enables Apollo Client to normalize those objects and cache them according to their `id` and `__typename` fields ([by default](../caching/cache-configuration/#generating-unique-identifiers)).

[In the example above](#example), our `ADD_TODO` mutation might return a `Todo` object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "__typename": "Todo",
  "id": "5",
  "text": "Buy grapes 🍇"
}
```

> Apollo Client automatically adds the `__typename` field to your queries and mutations by default.

Upon receiving this response object, Apollo Client caches it with key `Todo:5`. If a cached object _already_ exists with this key, Apollo Client overwrites any existing fields that are also included in the mutation response (other existing fields are preserved).

Returning modified objects like this is a helpful first step to keeping your cache in sync with your backend. However, it isn't always sufficient. For example, a newly cached object isn't automatically added to any _list fields_ that should now include that object. To accomplish this, you can define an `update` function.

#### The `update` function

A single mutation can create, modify, or delete any number of different entities in your data graph. Often, the mutation will return some representation of these updated entity objects as part of its result data. Apollo Client will automatically write these entity objects into the cache, which is sometimes enough to broadcast appropriate updates to your application, but not always.

While you could refetch all your queries to find out what changed after each mutation, a much more efficient solution is to pass an `update` function to `useMutation` to apply manual changes to your cached data, to match whatever modifications the mutation made to your back-end data.

The following sample illustrates defining an `update` function in a call to `useMutation`:

```jsx
const GET_TODOS = gql`
  query GetTodos {
    todos {
      id
    }
  }
`;

function AddTodo() {
  let input;
  const [addTodo] = useMutation(ADD_TODO, {
    update(cache, { data: { addTodo } }) {
      cache.modify({
        fields: {
          todos(existingTodos = []) {
            const newTodoRef = cache.writeFragment({
              data: addTodo,
              fragment: gql`
                fragment NewTodo on Todo {
                  id
                  type
                }
              `
            });
            return [...existingTodos, newTodoRef];
          }
        }
      });
    }
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <form
        onSubmit={e => {
          e.preventDefault();
          addTodo({ variables: { type: input.value } });
          input.value = "";
        }}
      >
        <input
          ref={node => {
            input = node;
          }}
        />
        <button type="submit">Add Todo</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

As shown, the `update` function is passed a `cache` object that represents the Apollo Client cache. This object provides access to cache API methods like `readQuery`, `writeQuery`, `readFragment`, `writeFragment`, `evict` and `modify`. These methods enable you to execute GraphQL operations on the cache as though you're interacting with a GraphQL server.

> Learn more about supported cache functions in [Interacting with cached data](../caching/cache-interaction/).

The `update` function is _also_ passed an object with a `data` property that contains the result of the mutation. You can use this value to update the cache with `cache.writeQuery`, `cache.writeFragment` or `cache.modify`.

> If your mutation specifies an [optimistic response](../performance/optimistic-ui/), your `update` function is called **twice**: once with the optimistic result, and again with the actual result of the mutation when it returns.

When the `ADD_TODO` mutation is run in the above example, the newly added and returned `addTodo` object is automatically saved into the cache before the `update` function runs. The previously cached list of `ROOT_QUERY.todos`, being watched by the `GET_TODOS` query, is not automatically updated. This means the `GET_TODOS` query isn't notified that a new todo was added, which then means the query will not update to show the new todo.

To address this we're using `cache.modify` which gives us a way to surgically insert or delete items from the cache, by running "modifier" functions. In the example above we know the results of the `GET_TODOS` query are stored in the `ROOT_QUERY.todos` array in the cache, so we're using a `todos` modifier function to update the cached array to include a reference to the newly added todo. With the help of `cache.writeFragment` we get an internal reference to the added todo, then append that reference to the `ROOT_QUERY.todos` array.

Any changes you make to cached data inside of an `update` function are automatically broadcast to queries that are listening for changes to that data. Consequently, your application's UI will update to reflect these updated cached values.

## `useMutation` API

Supported options and result fields for the `useMutation` hook are listed below.

Most calls to `useMutation` can omit the majority of these options, but it's
useful to know they exist. To learn about the `useMutation` hook API in more
detail with usage examples, see the [API reference](../api/react/hooks/).

### Options

The `useMutation` hook accepts the following options:

<MutationOptions />

### Result

The `useMutation` result is a tuple with a mutate function in the first position and an object representing the mutation result in the second position.

You call the mutate function to trigger the mutation from your UI.

<MutationResult />

## Next steps

The `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks together represent Apollo Client's core
API for performing GraphQL operations. Now that you're familiar with both,
you can begin to take advantage of Apollo Client's full feature set, including:

- [Optimistic UI](../performance/optimistic-ui/): Learn how to improve perceived performance by returning an optimistic response before your mutation result comes back from the server.
- [Local state](../local-state/local-state-management/): Use Apollo Client to manage the entirety of your application's local state by executing client-side mutations.
- [Caching in Apollo](../caching/cache-configuration/): Dive deep into the Apollo Client cache and how it's normalized. Understanding the cache is helpful when writing `update` functions for your mutations!
