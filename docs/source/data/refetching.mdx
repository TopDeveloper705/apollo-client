import RefetchQueriesOptions from '../../shared/refetchQueries-options.mdx';

Although Apollo Client allows you to make local modifications to previously
received GraphQL data by updating the cache, sometimes the easiest way to update
your client-side GraphQL data is to _refetch_ it from the server.

In principle, you could refetch every active query after any client-side update,
but you can save time and network bandwidth by refetching queries more
selectively, taking advantage of `InMemoryCache` to determine which watched
queries may have been invalidated by recent cache updates.

These two approaches (local updates and refetching) work well together: if your
application displays the results of local cache modifications immediately, you
can use refetching in the background to obtain the very latest data from the
server, rerendering the UI only if there are differences between local data and
refetched data.

Refetching is especially common after a mutation, so `client.mutate` accepts
options like `refetchQueries` and `onQueryUpdated` to specify which queries
should be refetched, and how. However, the tools of selective refetching are
available even if you are not performing a mutation, in the form of the
`client.refetchQueries` method.

## `client.refetchQueries`

### Refetch results

The `client.refetchQueries` method collects the `TResult` results returned by
`onQueryUpdated`, defaulting to `TResult = Promise<ApolloQueryResult<any>>` if
`onQueryUpdated` is not provided, and combines the results into a single
`Promise<TResolved[]>` using `Promise.all(results)`.

> Thanks to the `Promise`-unwrapping behavior of `Promise.all`, `TResolved` will
be the same type as `TResult` except when `TResult` is a
`PromiseLike<TResolved>` or a `boolean`.

The returned `Promise` object has two other useful properties:

| Property  | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `queries` | `ObservableQuery[]` | An array of `ObservableQuery` objects that were refetched |
| `results` | `TResult[]` | An array of results returned by `onQueryUpdated`, including pending promises |

These two arrays are parallel: they have the same length, and `results[i]` is
the result returned by `onQueryUpdated` when it was called with the
`ObservableQuery` given by `queries[i]`, for any index `i`.
